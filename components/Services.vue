      A number of employers underestimate the financial impact of that mental
      illness and poor organisational culture has on their bottom-line. Poor
      work culture as well as mental illness in the workplace leads to decreased
      productivity, increased sick-related absenteeism, poor work quality, loss
      of key staff and even compromised workplace safety. Despite the
      significant financial loss to employers, many of these crucial issues fly
      below the radar in the workplace and go unnoticed by leaders . Untreated
      mental disorders cost our economy more than R35 billion each year, with
      one in six South Africans suffering from severe depression or some form of
      mental disorder within their lifetime. Furthermore, bullying, conflict,
      unreasonable hours / demands, overt sexism, and racism are all clear signs
      that the culture of an organisation is potentially toxic and likely that
      productivity and the well-being of people in the organisation are
      affected. During this unprecedented period of change and increasing
      financial constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that
      staff feel engaged, valued and supported at work, in order to protect
      against mental illness as well as to encourage a healthy organisational
      culture. Therefore, it is more crucial that ever for leaders to listen
      closely and deeply to staff feelings and issues, which directly impact
      their everyday experience within the organisation and the organisation
      itself. Designing and maintaining structured, well-organised, and
      deliberate opportunities for employees to share their honest thoughts is
      an absolute necessity to create an atmosphere where a workforce feels
      valued, connected and engaged, and enables leaders to be far more in-tune
      with all dynamics and possible risks within their teams and organisation.
