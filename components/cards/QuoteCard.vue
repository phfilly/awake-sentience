        “Sentience is the capacity to be aware of feelings and sensations. The
        word was first coined by philosophers in the 1630s for the concept of an
        ability to feel, derived from Latin sentientem (a feeling), to
        distinguish it from the ability to think. In modern Western philosophy,
        sentience is the ability to experience sensations. In different Asian
        religions, the word 'sentience' has been used to translate a variety of
        concepts. In science fiction, the word 'sentience' is sometimes used
        interchangeably with sapience, self awareness or consciousness.”
