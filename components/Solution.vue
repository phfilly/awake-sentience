      Sentience Health was founded as a response to this identified need. A team
      of clinical psychologists and technology specialists combined their
      expertise to develop an innovative and proactive programme and service to
      gain insight into employee wellness as well as obtain employee feedback
      around organisational issues and needs. Sentience Health, has used a
      unique combination of psychology and technology to create an employee
      feedback program to serve as an effective platform to allow leaders to
      hear directly from staff and gain insight into organisational culture as
      well as monitor staff wellness. Without open employee feedback, management
      might not even be aware of issues that could be eroding employee
      productivity and negatively impacting workplace relationships and culture.
      <br /><br />
      Effective guidelines and courses of action can be generated based on the
      themes of psychologically analysed feedback captured by the employee
      feedback systems. Deeply rooted in psychological theory and practice,
      Sentience Health’s approach recognises employee experiences collected
      during employee feedback programs can often be limited in their range of
      openness due to fear of being misinterpreted, judged for their personal
      feelings and opinions as well as fear of negative repercussions based on
      the honesty of their opinions and feelings. Therefore, Sentience Health
      has developed and used the latest technology to allow for anonymity of
      employees in providing feedback. This, therefore allows employees to state
      and vent their true and honest feelings, which might otherwise be
      difficult to openly discuss or ‘unknown’ altogether.
      <br /><br />
      Providing staff complete anonymity not only provides a cathartic venting
      experience for employees but also enables the responses provided to inform
      and effectively shape organisational policies, procedures and
      interventions. Sentience Health’s anonymous employee feedback programme
      ensures maximum engagement with employees. Psychological analysis of
      feedback allows for leaders to gain insight into unknown dynamics
      affecting the organisation's culture or potential mental health issues and
      the risks that may be facing employees, thus allowing for necessary
      intervention to take place
