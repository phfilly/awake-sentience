          A number of employers underestimate the financial impact of that
          mental illness and poor organisational culture has on their
          bottom-line. Poor work culture as well as mental illness in the
          workplace leads to decreased productivity, increased sick-related
          absenteeism, poor work quality, loss of key staff and even compromised
          workplace safety. Despite the significant financial loss to employers,
          many of these crucial issues fly below the radar in the workplace and
          go unnoticed by leaders.<br /><br />
          Untreated mental disorders cost our economy more than R35 billion each
          year, with one in six South Africans suffering from severe depression
          or some form of mental disorder within their lifetime. Furthermore,
          bullying, conflict, unreasonable hours / demands, overt sexism, and
          racism are all clear signs that the culture of an organisation is
          potentially toxic and likely that productivity and the well-being of
          people in the organisation are affected. During this unprecedented
          period of change and increasing financial constraints of the COVID-19
          pandemic, it is imperative that staff feel engaged, valued and
          supported at work, in order to protect against mental illness as well
          as to encourage a healthy organisational culture. Therefore, it is
          more crucial that ever for leaders to listen closely and deeply to
          staff feelings and issues, which directly impact their everyday
          experience within the organisation and the organisation itself.
          Designing and maintaining structured, well-organised, and deliberate
          opportunities for employees to share their honest thoughts is an
          absolute necessity to create an atmosphere where a workforce feels
          valued, connected and engaged, and enables leaders to be far more
          in-tune with all dynamics and possible risks within their teams and
          organisation.
